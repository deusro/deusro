### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### About Me

Hello! I'm a student at the Private University of the North in Peru, and I am passionate about the world of machine learning. My focus lies particularly in image and sound recognition using the Keras library, and I thoroughly enjoy working with the Python programming language.

Furthermore, I have a keen interest in backend development and DevOps practices, always seeking to learn and improve in these areas. My goal is to actively contribute to open-source projects, fostering collaboration and shared learning.

Currently, I am dedicating efforts to create projects that not only enhance my portfolio but also add value to the community. I am open to collaborations and eager to learn from other talented developers.

It's a pleasure to meet you all, and I am excited about the opportunities that the development community offers. Let's create amazing things together!
